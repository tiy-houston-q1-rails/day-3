Day 3 - Classes
===============

### Goals

1. Pry
1. Scope
1. Classes
1. Inheritance
1. Initialize
1. Instance Variables

- A "class" is data (like a hash) plus behavior (methods)
- Instead of `{first_name: "Jesse", last_name: "Wolgamott"}`

```ruby
class Person
  def initialize(first_name, last_name)
    @first_name = first_name
    @last_name = last_name
  end
  def full_name
    [first_name, last_name].join(" ")
  end
end

jwo = Person.new("jesse", "wolgamott")
jwo.full_name
=> "jesse wolgamott"
```
